We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China.

</code></pre><p>On <strong>February 7</strong>, one day after talking to Xi Jinping, Trump <a href=https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-bob-woodward-conversation-transcript-trump-playing-down-coronavirus>told</a> Woodward that that Coronavirus &ldquo;goes through air&rdquo;, and &ldquo;more deadly than even your strenuous flus&rdquo;:</p><pre><code>It goes through air, Bob. That’s always tougher than the touch. The touch, you don’t have to touch things, right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed. And so that’s a very tricky one.

</code></pre><p>On <strong>February 8</strong>, one of the first CDC test kits were deployed. However, they just <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/04/03/coronavirus-cdc-test-kits-public-health-labs/>didn&rsquo;t work</a>.</p><p>On <strong>February 13</strong>, NYC Mayor de Blasio <a href=https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-fears-chinatown-lunar-new-year/5927131/>visited</a> Flushing, and encouraged New Yorkers to travel to Chinatown.

Instead, he warned about the flu:</p><pre><code>We have more kids dying of flu this year at this time than in the last decade or more.

Fauci: The masks are important for someone who’s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else... Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.

LaPook: You’re sure of it? Because people are listening really closely to this.

Fauci: ... There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.

What am I worried about as Governor? Nursing homes, senior congregate facilities, that is where we have to do our best work because that is a population that could be subject to a serious situation if the coronavirus was present there.

...

And also remember where this is going to be most problematic locally will be for those countries that don't have a sophisticated healthcare system. Luckily in this country, and certainly in this state, we have the most sophisticated healthcare system probably on the globe. So, we're coordinated, we're on top of it, we're diligent.
