Then said the king&amp;rsquo;s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king&amp;rsquo;s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 3</title><link>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/003/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/003/</guid><description>After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. And all the king&amp;rsquo;s servants, that were in the king&amp;rsquo;s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence. Then the king&amp;rsquo;s servants, which were in the king&amp;rsquo;s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king&amp;rsquo;s commandment?</description></item><item><title>Chapter 4</title><link>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/004/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/004/</guid><description>When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; And came even before the king&amp;rsquo;s gate: for none might enter into the king&amp;rsquo;s gate clothed with sackcloth. And in every province, whithersoever the king&amp;rsquo;s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 5</title><link>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/005/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/005/</guid><description>Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king&amp;rsquo;s house, over against the king&amp;rsquo;s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.

And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&amp;rsquo;s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom. Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request: For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 8</title><link>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/008/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/008/</guid><description>On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews&amp;rsquo; enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 9</title><link>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/009/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/009/</guid><description>Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king&amp;rsquo;s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 10</title><link>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/010/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.xizzhu.me/bible/kjv/esther/010/</guid><description>And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea. And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.</description></item></channel></rss>
